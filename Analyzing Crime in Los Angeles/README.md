# 🚓 LAPD Crime Pattern Analysis – Los Angeles, CA

Welcome to the **City of Angels**, where sunshine and palm trees meet the challenges of urban crime. In this data-driven project, I partnered with a simulation of the **Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)** to analyze crime patterns across the city and provide actionable insights.

## 📂 Dataset
The analysis is based on `crimes.csv`, containing timestamped crime reports from various neighborhoods in Los Angeles.

1. **⏰ When does crime peak?**  
   Identified the hour with the **highest frequency of crimes** (`peak_crime_hour`).

2. **🌙 Where do night crimes strike hardest?**  
   Analyzed crimes between **10 PM and 3:59 AM** to determine the **location with the highest nighttime criminal activity** (`peak_night_crime_location`).

3. **👥 Who are the most frequent victims?**  
   Categorized incidents by victim age group, producing a `victim_ages` Series showing **crime frequency across age brackets**:
   - `0-17`, `18-25`, `26-34`, `35-44`, `45-54`, `55-64`, `65+`
